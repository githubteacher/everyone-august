I don't really have a hometown, but below are the two places I lived longest before I could vote.

## Cortland, New York

### Local Highlights
#### Restaurants
 - Doug's Fish Fry
 - That one Chinese buffet that got shut down by the health department (great onions rings)
 - Friendly's?
#### Else
 - 1890s House is a lovely mansion/museum
 - I don't know why this won't format correctly in some views =(

### Adjacent Places
 - West is the Fingers Lakes region, with countless wineries and lake-related activities and hiking
 - North is Syracuse, with highlights such as the large mall and the zoo, and of course Dinosaur BBQ
 - South is Binghamton!  Not too exciting, but my grandparents live near there in Greene, and that town is appallingly quaint
 - East doesn't make sense to go, but eventually you get to the Catskills, and they're very pretty

## Iowa City, Iowa

### Local Highlights
 - People like Pagliai's, but they're wrong
 - Hamburg Inn No. 2 is worth visiting for the quadrennial bean vote (featured on the West Wing that once) and for the pie milkshakes
 - Java Hut is an excellent cafe
 - The Old Capitol downtown is worth a walkthrough
 - Mondo's is a delightful restaurant
 - As a college town, there are too many options to drink
 - There's a reservoir a bit to the north that has some lovely hiking trails
 - There are a lot of festivals going on.  I particularly like the jazz festival that lasts for several weeks over the summer.
### Adjacent Places
 - There is nothing worth visiting within an hour.  Maybe Cedar Rapids, but its highlights are a steakhouse and an IMAX.
 - Des Moines has a mall and Adventureland, which are nice, and the Quad Cities have some nice Mississippi-front views
 - Chicago's a four-hour drive away?
