## El Cerrito, CA

### Great Places to Eat

- The Royal Cafe is one of my favorite breakfast places. Definitely try the fresh-baked scones with homemade lemon curd!
- There is a burrito place, I think it's called Best Burrito, that's run by a Mexican man and his Japanese wife. Try the teriyaki burrito, with chicken or mushrooms-- it'll change your life.
- Mangia Mangia is my family's favorite Italian restaurant. I've yet to have anything there that I didn't like!

### Fun Things to Do

- The El Cerrito farmers market is a great way to spend a Saturday!
- There are many walking and hiking trails, both flat and paved and more rugged hilly terrain.
- The Contra Costa Civic Theater is a wonderful community playhouse!
- If you like more "luxury" cinema experiences a la the Alamo Drafthouse, catch a movie at the Cerrito Theater.

### Places to Avoid

- Be careful on the more isolated trails after dark, especially if you're alone. El Cerrito is a pretty safe town, but there have been muggings reported up there in the last few years.
